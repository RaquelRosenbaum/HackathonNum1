        <h4>Widget for Increasing Volunteer Enthusiasm </h4>
            <h5>For placement on charity organization website to make it more likely that people thinking about volunteering will convert to active volunteers (increase conversion rate of website)</h5>
            <h5>Making Volunteer Recruitment Easier, Faster, and most importantly, More Likely - Potential volunteers who are interested in an organization can see right on their webpage specifically what kinds of tasks the organization needs volunteer help with.  The project is a widget for a charity organization’s webpage.<br>
            This way people will be more motivated to volunteer, when they see the tasks they like and have knowledge, skills or experience with. By making this visible, enthusiasm is built because it’s more concrete and in-the-present, not buried behind a excessive amount of time spent on onboarding.<br> 
            Volunteers register by way of a form for their favorite types of tasks, one task on each card.<br>
            Registration is followed by a human screening phone call and intake process, which gives the volunteer token(s) for the tasks they are cleared to register for on a different page on the website. The volunteers can then go schedule themselves according to events and whether they have enough volunteers with the right skill tokens for each event. This project just goes as far as the steps prior to the human-implemented screening call/process.<br>
            </h5>
